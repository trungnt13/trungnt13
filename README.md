## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning engineer and researcher specialized in **probabilistic deep learning** and **digital signal processing**. I work with **images**, **speech** and **text** data, but also have experience with bioinformatics data.

I'm based in :finland: ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ and working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer.

In my quasi-free time, I write open-sourced deep learning framework in both **Tensorflow and Pytorch**. 

As a highly motivated and curious individual, I approach my work with unwavering responsibility and integrity.

:dart: **Notable works**:

- [Covid-Cough-Detection](https://github.com/trungnt13/Covid-Cough-Detection): using transformer and self-supervised learning for detecting covid from recorded cough audio file. 
- [ODIN](https://github.com/trungnt13/odin-ai): 28 different implementation of variational autoencoder and disentangled representation learning.
- [SISUA](https://github.com/trungnt13/sisua): semi-supervised single-cell modelling.
- [bigarray](https://github.com/trungnt13/bigarray): transparent memory-mapped array for multiprocessing (535 times faster than HDF5 data).

âš¡ **Fun projects**:

- [Neural style wedding card](https://github.com/trungnt13/neural-style-transfer): I used neural style transfer to create design for my wedding card <br> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trungnt13/neural-style-transfer/main/outputs/Style3_5.jpg" width="80">
- [Brick racing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trunganh.superbrickracing): Android version of the classic brick racing game <br> <img src="https://github.com/trungnt13/trungnt13/blob/main/brick_racing.png" width="64">
- [Coconerd](https://github.com/trungnt13/Code-counts): code count for nerd.
- [VSCode Autoflake](https://github.com/trungnt13/vscode-autoflake): extension for removing unused imports and unused variables from Python code.

- [Bayesian inference 2017](https://github.com/trungnt13/BAY2-uef17): using PyMC and Edward.
- [Python for Computational Intelligence (2017)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1owFx4cLxXv_FTOlgBQ2t-emsG_04a-Uf?usp=sharing): collection of Colab notebooks, recommended if you start using python solve some simple machine learning problems.
- [Deep learning course (2019)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17SDBkIue6QTlhiBKiuQ25zZTiHewL6g-?usp=sharing): 7 homeworks and 3 mini-projects, if you are motivated to solve the problems, please contact me via email.

:sunglasses: Hobbies:

- Climbing :mount_fuji:
- I am also an avid reader of mountaineering and science history.
- I also using ML for algorithmic trading and quant (just for fun).
