### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm machine learning engineer specialized in probabilistic deep learning. I work with both images and speech but also capable of doing natural language processing.
I'm based in Finland and working for University of Eastern Finland.

In my quasi-free time, I write deep learning framework in both Tensorflow and Pytorch. Occasionlly, I completely free my mind and my hand by climbing the mountains, and I am an avid reader of mountaineering and science history.

Notable works:

- [ODIN](https://github.com/trungnt13/odin-ai): 28 different implementation of variational autoencoder and disentangled representation learning.
- [SISUA](https://github.com/trungnt13/sisua): Semi-supervised single-cell modelling
